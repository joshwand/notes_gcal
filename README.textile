<pre>
$ gem install bundler

$ ruby notes_gcal.rb

h2. Caveats

This will *ERASE* any events on your google calendar that aren't already in Lotus Notes! I *HIGHLY* recommend creating a calendar in Google Calendar dedicated to Lotus Notes events.

h2. TODO

Fix sync algorithm to only delete events that exist in the cache but that don't exist anymore in lotus notes.

Does Google offer any non-plaintext auth methods?
